        <h1>Binary Tree</h1>
        <p>A <strong>binary tree</strong> is a data structure where each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. It is a hierarchical structure with a root node and various levels of descendants. Binary trees are fundamental in computer science and are used in various applications such as expression parsing, hierarchical data representation, and more.</p>

        <h2>Why Use a Binary Tree?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Data Representation:</strong> Ideal for representing hierarchical structures like file systems, organizational charts, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Searching and Sorting:</strong> Specialized binary trees, like binary search trees (BST), allow for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimized Data Retrieval:</strong> Operations such as in-order, pre-order, and post-order traversals help in accessing data in a structured manner.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Binary Trees</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Binary Search Tree (BST):</strong> A binary tree where the left child is less than the parent node, and the right child is greater. It allows for efficient searching and sorting.</li>
            <li><strong>Complete Binary Tree:</strong> A binary tree where all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level, which is filled from left to right.</li>
            <li><strong>Balanced Binary Tree:</strong> A binary tree where the height of the left and right subtrees of every node differ by no more than one, ensuring operations remain efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Full Binary Tree:</strong> A binary tree where every node has either 0 or 2 children.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Operations on Binary Tree</h2>

        <div class="operation">
            <h3>1. Insertion</h3>
            <p>Inserting a node into a binary tree involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BST:</strong> Inserting nodes while maintaining the BST property (left child < parent < right child).</li>
                <li><strong>Complete Tree:</strong> Adding nodes to the first available position from left to right.</li>
                <li><strong>Balanced Tree:</strong> Inserting nodes while maintaining balance criteria.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="operation">
            <h3>2. Deletion</h3>
            <p>Deleting a node from a binary tree involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Leaf Node:</strong> Simply removing the node.</li>
                <li><strong>Node with One Child:</strong> Replacing the node with its child.</li>
                <li><strong>Node with Two Children:</strong> Finding the in-order successor or predecessor and replacing the node with it.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="operation">
            <h3>3. Traversal</h3>
            <p>Traversing a binary tree involves visiting all the nodes in a specific order:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>In-order Traversal:</strong> Visit left subtree, root, right subtree.</li>
                <li><strong>Pre-order Traversal:</strong> Visit root, left subtree, right subtree.</li>
                <li><strong>Post-order Traversal:</strong> Visit left subtree, right subtree, root.</li>
                <li><strong>Level-order Traversal:</strong> Visit nodes level by level from top to bottom.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="operation">
            <h3>4. Searching</h3>
            <p>Searching in a binary tree involves:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>BST:</strong> Efficiently searching based on the BST property.</li>
                <li><strong>Other Trees:</strong> May require traversal to find a specific value.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="operation">
            <h3>5. Finding Depth and Height</h3>
            <p>Depth and height are important properties of a binary tree:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Depth:</strong> The number of edges from the root to a specific node.</li>
                <li><strong>Height:</strong> The number of edges on the longest path from a node to a leaf.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Use Cases</h2>
        <p>Binary trees are widely used in various applications, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Expression Parsing:</strong> Used in compilers and calculators for parsing and evaluating expressions.</li>
            <li><strong>Hierarchical Data:</strong> Suitable for representing hierarchical data like organizational structures or file systems.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Set Operations:</strong> Efficiently supports operations such as search, insert, and delete in various data structures like priority queues and associative arrays.</li>
        </ul>
